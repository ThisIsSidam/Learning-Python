# Learning-Python

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 

I went through the files after about one and a half years of creating them. 
And to be honest, they have lots of errors. In some places, the code may have
errors. But mostly, it has lots of grammatical errors. So please ignore that. 
Lots of times, the explanation is also not good. 

One of the reasons is that when I was learning Python and making these notes. 
I didn't have a Laptop that I have now. I was coding and making these notes from
a simulated Linux in a budget Android device with an attached keyboard. Hence all
these mistakes. Don't mind it. Not like you'll ever be reading these notes for 
learning the language. You can search the Internet anytime you want.

This repo. contains Python files,
kind of like my notes on Python.

Also, I named the main files Day1 and
Day2, but it doesn't mean they are
Created in a single day, some are created 
in the two-three day time because sometimes I
got stuck, and occasionally I got interrupted. 
And on sometimes, I even made multiple
files in a day. I study little by little,
so that's that.
